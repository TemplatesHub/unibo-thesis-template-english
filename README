The template contains a series of __additional commands__ that can help you create an even greater looking thesis!  
Finally, through automation, you can __easily make your thesis document available online__ so that you will always have an easy-to-access way to get your compiled document from anywhere.

## Tutorial
By clicking on ➡️ [this link](https://github.com/TemplatesHub/unibo_thesis_template/releases/latest) ⬅️ (or by going in the "__Releases__" section of this repository), you will get the latest draft of the document produced by this template.  
The document, other than showing the final result, contains a tutorial explaining how to use this template.

## Compile the Document on VSCode
### Install the recommended dependencies
Upon opening the project VSCode will ask you if you want to install the required dependencies; proceed to install them.  

Alternatively, recommended dependencies can be found under the extensions tab typing _@recommended_ in the search bar.

### Install required software (Windows)
Follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lyHIQl4VM8) tutorial to install the required software on Windows (if you installed the recommended dependencies you will already have LaTeX Workshop on VSCode).

## Releasing the PDF document
Despite being able to compile your document locally, you may want to release it in your repository; in order to do that, you can use the following commands to create a new release that will automatically generate your PDF document, making it available as an attachment in your latest repository's release.  

First create a new tag, including a message that sums up the notes for the new release. Note that the tag must begin with "v" (ex: v1.0.5).
```console
git tag -a v<VERSION> -m "<RELEASE NOTES>" 
```
Then push the new tag to the remote repository, triggering a workflow, crating automatically a new release with the compiled PDF document.
```console
git push origin --tags
```
Once the workflow is over, you will find your compiled document attached in the latest release of your repository.
